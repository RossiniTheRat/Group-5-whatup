# Group-5-whatup

**Description**

This application will let the user click a generate button that will display a random image from the Museum of Arts' API database of artworks and a random quote from quotable.io API database.

**What Problem does it Solve?**

The Metropolitan Museum of Art "does not require API users to register or obtain an API key to use the service". This saves an additional step of requesting an API key, which is a required step by other API Websites.

**Usage** 

The project contains HTML, CSS, and JavaScript codes. The main objective of this project is to enable users to obtain inspirational quote(s) with images(s) from the application's Website.

A user clicks on the Generate button. A random image is displayed on the screen simultaneously with a motivational quote that is displayed within the quote section.

**Credits/References**
